Find the segments to attack!


Initial goal is to look at all of the segments a user and ridden, and find the segments where they have a friend who is ranked ahead of them. Now the user knows which segments to attack!

Would be fun to figure out how to have it generate a route that runs you through a handful of segments identified above.
